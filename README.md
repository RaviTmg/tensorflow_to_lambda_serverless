# Tensorflow to AWS lambda
This project is the companion code for my Medium post on deploying tensorflow models to AWS lambda (using [Serverless](https://serverless.com/)): in a few minutes and a few lines of Python code you can serve predictions from a trained model through a lambda-powered endpoint. 

Please refer to the Medium blog [post](https://medium.com/@jacopotagliabue/serving-tensorflow-predictions-with-python-and-aws-lambda-facb4ab87ddd#.v01eyg8kh) for a full explanation on the code structure and how to deploy it.
